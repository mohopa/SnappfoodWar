Project Structure

The project is structured into multiple modules to promote reusability, maintainability, and separation of concerns:

App Module: The entry point of the application, containing the presentation layer and connecting the DI graph from different modules.
Domain Module: Contains business logic, use cases, and domain models. This module is platform-independent and only relies on Kotlin and domain-specific logic.
Data Module: Implements the repository pattern, handling data sources, networking, and local data storage. This module abstracts the data sources and provides a clean API for the domain layer.

Kit Module: A collection of reusable UI components implemented with Jetpack Compose. This module helps in maintaining consistent UI patterns across the application.
Key Technologies and Libraries

Kotlin Coroutines: Used for asynchronous operations, providing a straightforward and efficient way to handle background tasks and network requests.
Jetpack Compose: The modern toolkit for building native Android UIs. The project uses Compose for all UI elements, ensuring a declarative and reactive approach to UI development.

Koin: A lightweight dependency injection framework used to manage and inject dependencies across the modules. Each module defines its own DI setup, and the app module connects them together.
Navigation Component: Utilized for managing navigation between different screens in a type-safe and scalable manner within Jetpack Compose.

Dependency Injection Setup
Each module in the project defines its own Koin DI module. The app module combines these modules to create a cohesive DI graph.

Domain Module: Provides use cases and domain-related dependencies.
Data Module: Provides repositories and data-related dependencies such as network services or local databases.

App Module: Injects ViewModels, connects the DI modules from other layers, and provides any app-specific dependencies.


Clean Architecture Implementation
The project strictly follows Clean Architecture principles:

Domain Layer: Contains pure Kotlin code without any dependencies on Android or other frameworks. It holds the business logic and use cases.

Data Layer: Responsible for fetching data from various sources (network, local storage) and exposing it to the domain layer via repositories.
Presentation Layer: Includes the UI, ViewModels, and UI-specific logic. Jetpack Compose is used for building reactive UIs, and ViewModels interact with the domain layer to fetch and manage data.


Navigation
The project uses the Navigation Component to manage screen transitions in a type-safe manner within Jetpack Compose. This approach ensures a clear and manageable navigation flow.
